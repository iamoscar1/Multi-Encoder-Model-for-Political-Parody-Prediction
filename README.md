# Multi-Encoder-Model-for-Political-Parody-Prediction
This repository includes the core part of codes for the paper "Combining Humor and Sarcasm for Improving Political Parody Detection" accepted in NAACL 2022. Also, pre-trained Humor and Sarcasm semantic encoders are included for convenient use. You can download them and put them in the corresponding directory. Some hyper-parametrs have been adjusted to recent experiments but the main idea remains the same. More details can be found in the paper.
